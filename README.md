Error: local-pkg tried to access jsdom, but it isn't declared in its dependencies; this makes the require call ambiguous and unsound.

Required package: jsdom (via "jsdom/package.json")
Required by: local-pkg@npm:0.4.3 (via .yarn/cache/local-pkg-npm-0.4.3-de61dda1fd-7825aca531.zip/node_modules/local-pkg/index.mjs)
```

It's a problem with how yarn is resolving the dependency at the top level when in PnP mode.
This can be resolved by [declaring the resoltuion in the .yarnrc.yml](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/3082#issuecomment-606641463).

e.g. the following

```
packageExtensions:
  "local-pkg@*":
    dependencies:
      "jsdom": "*"
```

would resolve the problem seen above.

**Note**: You would need to re-run `yarn install` prior to running the command that caused the issue.
